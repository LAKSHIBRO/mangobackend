# New Frontend Implementation for Happy Mango Tours

This document outlines how the new frontend from `new_frontend` folder has been integrated into the Laravel project.

## Directory Structure

- **Original Frontend**: `resources/views/frontend/pages/` (original blade templates)
- **New Frontend**: `resources/views/frontend/pages/new_*.blade.php` (new blade templates)
- **Assets**: `public/new_frontend/` (contains CSS, images, and other assets)

## Key Components

1. **Layout**: `resources/views/frontend/new_layout.blade.php`
2. **Header**: `resources/views/frontend/components/new_header.blade.php`
3. **Footer**: `resources/views/frontend/components/new_footer.blade.php`

## Pages Implemented

- Home (`new_home.blade.php`)
- About (`new_about.blade.php`)
- Services/Tour Packages (`new_service.blade.php`)
- Gallery (`new_gallery.blade.php`)
- Blog (`new_blog.blade.php`) and Blog Detail (`new_blog_detail.blade.php`)
- Contact (`new_contact.blade.php`)

## Dynamic Components

- Blog Load More: `resources/views/frontend/components/blog/new_load_more_blogs.blade.php`
- Gallery Load More: `resources/views/frontend/components/gallery/new_load_more_galleries.blade.php`

## Usage

All routes in `web.php` have been kept the same, but the FrontendController methods have been updated to use the new templates.

## Assets Management

The assets from the original `new_frontend` folder have been copied to `public/new_frontend/` and are referenced using Laravel's `asset()` helper in the templates.

## Interactive Features

### Tour Package Inquiry System

A fully-functional inquiry system for tour packages has been implemented with the following features:

1. **Database Storage**: Inquiries are saved to the database via the `inquiries` table
2. **Form Validation**: Client and server-side validation for all form fields
3. **User Experience**: 
   - Success notifications with auto-hide functionality (5 seconds timeout)
   - Form value persistence after validation errors
   - Interactive elements (click-to-dismiss notifications)
4. **Data Model**: 
   - `Inquiry` model with relationship to `TourPackage`
   - Properly defined table schema with appropriate field types

### Location

Tour package inquiry form is located in `resources/views/frontend/pages/tour_package_detail.blade.php`

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement proper Tailwind compilation for production use
2. Further optimize image assets
3. Implement responsive improvements
4. Add custom JavaScript for interactive elements
5. Add administrator backend for managing and responding to inquiries
6. Implement email notifications for new inquiries
