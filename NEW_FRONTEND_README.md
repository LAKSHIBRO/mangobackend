# New Frontend Implementation for Happy Mango Tours

This document outlines how the new frontend from `new_frontend` folder has been integrated into the Laravel project.

## Directory Structure

- **Original Frontend**: `resources/views/frontend/pages/` (original blade templates)
- **New Frontend**: `resources/views/frontend/pages/new_*.blade.php` (new blade templates)
- **Assets**: `public/new_frontend/` (contains CSS, images, and other assets)

## Key Components

1. **Layout**: `resources/views/frontend/new_layout.blade.php`
2. **Header**: `resources/views/frontend/components/new_header.blade.php`
3. **Footer**: `resources/views/frontend/components/new_footer.blade.php`

## Pages Implemented

- Home (`new_home.blade.php`)
- About (`new_about.blade.php`)
- Services/Tour Packages (`new_service.blade.php`)
- Gallery (`new_gallery.blade.php`)
- Blog (`new_blog.blade.php`) and Blog Detail (`new_blog_detail.blade.php`)
- Contact (`new_contact.blade.php`)

## Dynamic Components

- Blog Load More: `resources/views/frontend/components/blog/new_load_more_blogs.blade.php`
- Gallery Load More: `resources/views/frontend/components/gallery/new_load_more_galleries.blade.php`

## Usage

All routes in `web.php` have been kept the same, but the FrontendController methods have been updated to use the new templates.

## Assets Management

The assets from the original `new_frontend` folder have been copied to `public/new_frontend/` and are referenced using Laravel's `asset()` helper in the templates.

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement proper Tailwind compilation for production use
2. Further optimize image assets
3. Implement responsive improvements
4. Add custom JavaScript for interactive elements
